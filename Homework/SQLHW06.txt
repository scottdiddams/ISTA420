1. What does a set operator do?

*Set operators combine rows from two query result sets (multisets). Some operators remove duplicates from the result & hence return a set*

2. What are the general requirements of a set operator

*The two input queries must produce results with the same number of columns, and corresponding columns must have compatible data types*

3. What is a Venn Diagram? This is not in the book.

*A diagram of logical relations between two or more sets - ( A (A&B) B ) *

4. Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION operator. What does it do?

*(X(x)X) - merges the results of the two select statemens - only returns unique/distinct statements*

5. Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION ALL operator. What does it do?

* (X) (x) - returns all the results without deleting duplicaties*

6. Draw a Venn Diagram of the INTERSECT operator. What does it do?

*( (X) ) - returns only the common items in the two sets*

7. If SQL Server supported the INTERSECT ALL operator, what would it do?

*Return the duplicate values of the common items*

8. Draw a Venn Diagram of the EXCEPT operator. What does it do?

*(X( ) ) returns the first table without any items in common between the two sets (also called minus)*

9. If SQL Server supported the EXCEPT ALL operator, what would it do?

*It would do exaclty what the except operator does, but silently judge you while doing it*

10. What is the precedence of the set operators?

*INTERSECT precedes UNION & EXCEPT, which are both evaluated by order of appearance*

11. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is all elements in A that are also not in A and B, and all
elements of B that are also not in A and B. For example, if set A consisted of all integers between 1 and
100 that are divisible by 2, and set B consisted of all integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by
3, the symmetric difference of A and B would include all integers in A and B except integers divisible
by both 2 and 3, e.g., 6, 12, 18, etc. Write a SQL query that computes the symmetric difference of two
tables A and B.

```
(
select * from numbers where (num % 3) = 0
except
select * from numbers where (num % 2) = 0
)
union
(
select * from numbers where (num % 2) = 0
except
select * from numbers where (num % 3) = 0
)
```
