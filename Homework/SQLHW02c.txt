1. List the date/time types in T-SQL.

```
DATETIME //YYYYMMDD hh:mm:ss.nnn
SMALLDATETIME //YYYYMMDD hh:mm
DATE //YYYY-MM-DD
TIME //hh:mm:ss.nnnnnnn
DATETIME2 //YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.nnnnnnn
DATETIMEOFFSET //YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.nnnnnnn [+|-] hh:mm
```


2. How do you express a date/time literal in T-SQL?

*string literal = "YYYYMMDD" - use a character string to express a date/time value, and convert it to a date/time type:*
```
orderdate = CAST('20160212' AS DATE);
```

3. What is the setting DATEFORMAT used for?

*determines how SQL server interprets the literals you enter - use the command SET DATEFORMAT:*
```
SET LANGUAGE British;
SELECT CAST('02/12/2016' AS DATE); ///Outputs 2016-12-02

SET LANGUAGE us_english;
SELECT CAST('02/12/2016' AS DATE); //Outputs 2016-02-12
```

4. Wriite a T-SQL snippet changing the date format to German. Read the documentation on how to do
this.

```
SET LANGUAGE German;
SELECT CAST('20210124' AS DATE);

5. What is the difference between CAST(), CONVERT(), and PARSE()?

*CONVERT: converts the literal to the requested data type and alloes you to specify a style*
```
SELECT CONVERT(DATE, '02/12/2016', [style]) //ex: style 101 produces "February 12, 2016"; style 103 produces "December 2, 2016"
```
*Parse: parse a value as a requested type and indicate the culture*
```
SELECT PARSE('02/12/2016' AS DATE USING 'en-US'); //Produces February 12, 2016; if 'en-GB', produces December 2, 2016
```
*Cast simply changes the type - as above* 

6. What function returns the current date? This is very useful in a table that maintains a log of events,
such as user logins.

```
select date('now');
```

7. How do you add one day to the current date? Add one week? Add one month? Add one year?

```
select date('now', '+1 day');
select date('now','+1 week');
select date('now', '+1 month', '+1 year');
```

8. Write a SQL snippet to return the number of years between your birth date and todayâ€™s date.

```
select date('now')-date('1993-12-08');
```

9. How do you check a string literal to see if it represents a valid date?

*use the ISDATE(expression) function*
```
IF ISDATE('2009-05-12 10:19:41.177') = 1  
    PRINT 'VALID'  
ELSE  
    PRINT 'INVALID';
```

10. What does EOMONTH() do? Give an example of why this might be very useful.

*EOMONTH(startDate [,monthToAdd]) returns the last day of the month containing a specified date with an optional offset*
*Could be useful for tracking the expiration of a monthly service or budgetary constraint*

11. Payments are due exactly 30 days from the date of the last function. Write a select query that calculates
the date of the next payment. Pretend we want to update a column in a database that contains the
date of the next payment. We will do this when we write UPDATE queries.

```
select date('lastDate','+30 day');
```

12. Suppose your son or daughter wants to run a query every day that tells them the number of days until
their 16th birthday. Write a select query that does this.

```
select julianday('YYYY-MM-DD') - julianday('now');  //where YYYY-MM-DD is the 16th birthday
```
