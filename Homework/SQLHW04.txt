## SQL HW 04

1. In your own words, what is a subquery?

*A subquery is a query within a query that acts siilar to a join statement a "select within a select"*

2. In your own words, what is a self contained subquery?

*A self-contained subquery selects from a table unassociated with the outer query*

3. In your own words, what is a correlated subquery?

*A correlated subquery selects from the same table as the outer query*

4. Give an example of a subquery that returns a single value. When would you use this kind of subquery?

*Scalar subqueries could be used to identify a single key representing a desired feature, and run the outer query to allocate the associated data*
```
SELECT orderid, orderdate, empid, custid
FROM Sales.Orders
WHERE orderid = (SELECT MAX(O.orderid)
                 FROM Sales.Orders AS O);
```

5. Give an example of a subquery that returns multiple values. When would you use this kind of subquery?

*Multivalued subqueries could be used to identify a key column that meets a desired quality and retrieve the associated data*
```
SELECT orderid
FROM Sales.Orders
WHERE empid IN
  (SELECT E.empid
   FROM HR.Employees AS E
   WHERE E.lastname LIKE N'D%');
```

6. Give an example of a subquery that returns table values. When would you use this kind of subquery?

*A table subquery would accomplish much of what the JOIN function accomplishes - link different relations*

7. What does the exists predicate do? Give an example.

*EXISTS returns a true or false outcome - for example it can tell you what customers have made purchases in spain:"
```
SELECT custid, companyname
FROM Sales.Customers AS C
WHERE country = N'Spain'
  AND EXISTS
    (SELECT * FROM Sales.Orders AS O
     WHERE O.custid = C.custid);
```

8. What happens if we use the not operator before a predicate? Give an example.

*It will tell you what has NOT fulfilled the predicate - ie who has not ordered from spain:*
```
SELECT custid, companyname
FROM Sales.Customers AS C
WHERE country = N'Spain'
  AND NOT EXISTS
    (SELECT * FROM Sales.Orders AS O
     WHERE O.custid = C.custid);
```

9. When you use exists or not exists with respect to a row in a database, does it return two or three
values? Explain your answer.

*It will return the values you ask for*

10. How would you use a subquery to calculate aggregates? For example, you want to calculate yearly
sales of a product, and you also want to keep a running sum of total sales. Explain how you would use
a subquery to do this.

*Move the aggregate inside the subquery*
```
select sale_quantity, sum((select ...)) as sum_total...
```
