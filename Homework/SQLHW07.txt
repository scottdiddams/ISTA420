1. What is a window function?

*A function that, for each row, computes a scaler result value (simple single numeric value) based on a calculation against a subset of the rows (the window) from the underlying query. The syntax is the OVER clause*

2. What does PARTITION do?

*restricts the window to a subset of rows that have the same values in the partitioning columns as in the current row. ie - partition by empid to have all rows accosiated with empid 1 populate at the top, followed by empid 2 etc...*

3. What does ORDER BY do?

*orders in support of a frame specification - a compartmentalized ORDER BY*

4. What does ROWS BETWEEN do?

*filters the frame or subset of rows from the window partition between two specified delimiters (x AND y) - ie -*
```
ELECT empid, ordermonth, val,
  SUM(val) OVER(PARTITION BY empid
                ORDER BY ordermonth
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING --unbound preceding means all previous rows (sums everything up to that point)
                         AND CURRENT ROW) AS runval
FROM Sales.EmpOrders;
```

5. What is a ranking window function? Why would you use it? Give an example.

*used to rank each row with respect to others in the window. there are four ranking functions:*
```
ROW_NUMBER() -- assigns incremental sequential integers
RANK() -- reflects the count of rows that have a lower ordering value
DENSE_RANK() -- reflects the count of distinct ordering values below the ordering value.
NTILE(number of tiles requested) -- Used to associate the rows with "tiles" (equallysized groups of rows) by assigning a tile number to each row.
```

6. What is an offset window function? Why would you use it? Give an example.

*used to return an element from a row that is at a certain offset from the current row or at the end of a window frame*

7. What do LEAD and LAG DO

*Used to obtain an element from a row that is at a certain offset from the current row within the partition, based on the indicated ordering*
```
LAG(element [, offset]) -- looks before the current row
LEAD(element [, offset]) -- looks ahead of the current row

8. What do FIRST VALUE and LAST VALUE do?

*used to return an element from the first and last rows in the window frame, respectively.*

9. What is an aggragate window function? Why would you use it? Give an example.

*use the OVER keyword - Perform calculations across a set of rows and returns an additional column attached to each row with the result - could be useful for comparrisons*

10. What is a pivot table and what does it do?

*PIVOT converts rows into columns*

11. In mathematical theory, what is a power set? How does this definition of power set relate to grouping
sets?

*The powerset of set S is all subsets of S - a grouping set is a set of expressions you group the data by in a grouped query (using GROUP BY) - a powerset would be a set of all possible grouped queries in a table*

12. What is a bit array? How can you implement a bit array to represent a set of flags? How does the
GROUPING ID() function implement a bit array?

*a bit array is an array of boolean values - grouping_ID returns an integer value of the level of grouping and can be used to return a 1 or 0*

13. Read the documentation on the UNIX/Linux chmod command. How would interpret this command:
chmod 755 myscript.sql?

*chmod (change mode) changes the access permissions of file system objects - 755 = (7) read/write/execute for User class, (5) read/execute for group class, (5) read/execute for other class
